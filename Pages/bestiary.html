                            A bestiary is usually a volume containing information on different creatures, 
                            either living or mythical, depending on the focus of the treatise. 
                            In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and its expansions, Hearts of Stone expansion and
                             Blood and Wine expansion, there are many beasts to discover and slay in your 
                             adventures as Geralt. As you come across new creatures all of the information you
                              know about them is entered into this book. This Information can be found out by simply 
                              finding and engaging the monster or by reading certain books. Be aware that all animals
                               and beasts Geralt kills have an actual scent that attracts other monsters in the area.

                            bints masquerading as lost old women to lure
                            travelers back to the rickety shacks they build in the wetlands.
                            In truth, only a blind man, or a sighted man blinded with drink, could 
                            mistake the rank sludge and rotting carrion of a water hag's den for a cozy 
                            cottage, and the hideous hag herself for an innocent grandmother. 
                            Their wrinkled, wart-covered bodies stand nearly two yards tall, 
                            with skin the color of a long-dead cadaver and stinking of muck and fish.
                            Bony growths two spans long stick out from their backs, with hair like a 
                            tangle of seaweed and claws that would make a werewolf proud completing the 
                            picture.

                            about creatures ferocious and benign,
                             friendly and hostile. As they started to settle deeper and deeper into the forests, 
                             respect for the unknown diminished. Lumber was gathered, stone abodes were built. 
                             As the pestilence that was humanity grew bigger, so did the forest's and its inhabitants' wrath.

                            At the heart of the forest lies a secret. 
                            In a place born of darkness and primeval nature, 
                            resides a mighty and terrifying guardian. 
                            Immune to human steel, it is believed the leshen is nature's way of protecting 
                            the forest and the animals that live within it from the threat humans 
                            started to pose upon their ravaging expansion deeper into the lands..

                            the leshen became a force to be reckoned with. 
                            Sometimes worshipped, this creature can heal other 
                            woodland animals and summon nekkers or crows to protect the forest. 
                            Its attacks are slow, but deadly — be cautious not to get shackled by 
                            its underground roots.

                            Fiercely territorial creatures, they hunt with stealth and cunning as their 
                            only companions. They use their inborn magic to control the plants and animals
                            within their territory – and so, when stalking them, half the battle is merely
                            getting near enough to strike. Leshens old enough to earn the appellation
                            "ancient" wield advanced skills and tactics that make them particularly dangerous.

                            Instead, draw your sword – for before you stands a rock troll. 
                            True, not every encounter with these creatures ends in a fight - 
                            while not particularly intelligent, trolls are capable of reason –
                             but it is better to prepare for the worst. Otherwise, your hike might 
                             end not on the summit, but in their stew.

                            Trolls are able to use fire and simple tools,
                            and some of them have even mastered the basics of Common Speech.
                            Though linguistic nuances such as conjugations and declinations escape them,
                            they are extremely fond of riddles, rhymes and all sorts of wordplay,
                            a fact a witcher in possession of a bit of wit can use to his advantage

                            one must watch out for the stones these trolls throw with great strength 
                            and shocking precision. Their powerful, heavy fists also present a danger, 
                            for they can buckle even the sturdiest breastplate or cuirass. Since their 
                            backs are covered in a layer of rocky growth, blows delivered from behind will 
                            not do them much damage. They must thus be fought directly, standing face to 
                            face – and preferably armed with a sword covered in a fresh coating of ogroid oil.
