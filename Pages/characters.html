            <p> <h4>Geralt of Rivia</h4> 
              Geralt of Rivia (Polish: Geralt z Rivii), known also as Gwynnbleid (Old Speech: "White Wolf", given to him by the Dryads) or the "Butcher of Blaviken", is a witcher and the protagonist of the Witcher series and its adaptations. He has been described as a character embodifying "the neo-liberal anti-politics" spirit of the Polish popular culture of the 1990s.
              
              Geralt was portrayed by Michał Żebrowski in the 2001 Polish television adaptation The Hexer, and by Henry Cavill in the 2019 Netflix original series The Witcher.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h4>Yennefer of Vengerberg</h4>
              Sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg (known as Yen or Yenna) (Polish: Yennefer z Vengerbergu) first appeared in the collection of short stories, The Last Wish, featuring in both "The Last Wish" short story and "The Voice of Reason" frame story. She went on to appear in numerous other Witcher stories and is one of the main characters of the Witcher saga.

              Yennefer is Geralt's "soul mate" although their relationship is difficult and full of drama. Both Geralt and Yennefer are sterile, which adds another level of tragedy to the mix. Yennefer has a hard time accepting the fact and tries various methods of restoring her fertility. Yennefer ends up becoming a mother to Ciri while teaching her and watching over her while she was at Ellander.

              Yennefer was born on Belleteyn of the year 1173. She lived in the capital city of Aedirn, Vengerberg. She is one of the most powerful mages on the continent and is surpassed by only a handful. She is the youngest member of the Council of Sorcerers and later she became a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses. During the Battle of Sodden Hill she was blinded by Fringilla Vigo, a Nilfgaardian sorceress. Her sight was magically restored.

              Yennefer was famous for her beauty, even though during the events of The Swallow's Tower, she was 94 years old. She always dressed in black and white clothing. She used lilac and gooseberry perfumes. She had violet eyes and raven black hair. Before becoming a sorceress, she was a hunchback, but had her deformities fixed by Tissaia de Vries while being an apprentice although Geralt is able to see the subtle clues that let him figure out the truth.

              At the end of the books, Yennefer ends up getting mortally wounded while trying to heal Geralt and along with him gets taken to the world of Camelot by Ciri where they live on an island.

            <p>
              <h4>Ciri</h4>
              Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, known as Ciri, the Lion Cub of Cintra, Zireael and the Lady of Time and Space, is the princess of Cintra, daughter of Pavetta and Duny (also known as the Urcheon of Erlenwald) and granddaughter of Queen Calanthe. She is also Geralt's and Yennefer's adopted daughter, around whom much of the plot is centered. Ciri is a descendant of Lara Dorren and has the Elder blood which gives her access to powers that allow her to cross space and time. Ciri has ashen grey hair and green emerald eyes, a trait that runs in her family.

              Ciri was trained under the watchful eyes of Geralt, Coën, Vesemir, Lambert, Eskel, and Triss while at Kaer Morhen and became talented with a sword. Later, she ended up training as a sorceress while living with Yennefer at Ellander. After the Thanedd coup, Ciri became separated from Geralt and Yennefer, created an unstable portal, and by going through it found herself in the Korath desert. After her time in the desert, she ended up joining a gang called the Rats, but then got herself captured by a bounty hunter by the name of Leo Bonhart and was forced to fight in an arena. She later escaped and fled to the world of Aen Elle. During her time with the Aen Elle, she was going to be forced to procreate with the King, although in the end she was able to avoid this. She later escaped from that world and after traveling through time, she was finally reunited with Geralt and Yen. She travelled with them for a few months before their untimely deaths.

              At the end of the books, Ciri ends up taking Geralt and Yennefer to another world while she finds herself in the world of Camelot where they live on an island.

              Dandelion (Polish: Jaskier) is a poet, minstrel, bard, and Geralt's best friend. The Polish word jaskier actually refers to the Buttercup flower (Ranunculus). Some of his more famous ballads were about the relationship between Geralt and Yennefer. By the time of the saga he was already in his 40s though it was said that he looked like he was in his 30s and was often mistaken for an elf. He accompanies Geralt in many of the short stories and ends up joining his hansa while searching for Ciri but left it before the deadly assault on Stygga. He would later rejoin Geralt and witness his and Yennefer's death at Rivia. He is known as a fan favorite due to his very like-able character.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h4>King Foltest</h4>
              King Foltest is the king of Temeria, and involved in an incestuous affair with his own sister that produced a daughter, although both the mother and child die in childbirth. They are buried in the family crypt beneath the family castle. However, 5 years later the situation and magic of the fantasy setting cause the daughter to become an undead beast called a Stryga that kills villagers and forces the royal family of Temeria to abandon their castle and let it fall in ruins. King Foltest forbids anyone to destroy the Striga and eventually hires Geralt to lift the curse of the daughter he dearly loves. Geralt is successful, and the girl returns to life as a 15 year old, but uneducated and must be taught to speak and behave as a person.

            <h2>Geralt of Rivia</h2>
            
            <section>
            <p> 
              Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of 
              the Wolf active throughout the 13th century. 
              He loved sorceress Yennefer, considered the love of 
              his life despite their tumultuous relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.
            </p> 
            <p>
              During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance for the mutagens
              that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly, Geralt was subjected to further 
              experimental mutagens which rendered his 
              hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite his title, Geralt did not hail from the city of Rivia. 
              After being left with the witchers by his mother, Visenna, 
              he grew up in their keep of Kaer Morhen in the realm of Kaedwen. 
              In the interest of appearing more trustworthy to potential clients, 
              young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir.
              As his first choice, Geralt chose "Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde",
              but this choice was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious, so 
              "Geralt" was all that remained of his chosen name. "Of Rivia" was a more practical 
              alternative and Geralt even went so far as to adopt a Rivian accent to appear more authentic.
              Later, Queen Meve of Lyria knighted him for his valor in the Battle for the Bridge on the 
              Yaruga conferring on him the formal title "of Rivia", which amused him. He, therefore, became
              a true knight.
            </p>

            <h3>Biography</h3><hr>
            <h4>Childhood</h4>
            <p>
              Geralt was the son of the sorceress Visenna and, presumably, the warrior Korin, but when he was 
              born Visenna left him with the School of the Wolf at Kaer Morhen. There, Geralt was trained and 
              made to be a witcher. He survived the many blistering mutations required to grant witchers their a
              bilities and passed the Trial of the Grasses. Geralt's intensive training and the mutagenic 
              experimentation carried out upon him, granted him considerably greater strength, speed, 
              endurance, resilience, 
              healing, senses, complete immunity to diseases and conventional poisons, and extreme resistance to pain
            </p>
            <h4>Early life</h4>
            <p>During his training at the witcher school, 
              he made friends with several students, suchs Gweld and 
              Eskel, and was trained by Vesemir in harsh conditions, 
              one in which resulted in a student dying.
            </p>
            <p>
              Geralt was eventually put through the Trial of Forest Eyes, 
              where he was left tied up in the woods and blindfolded and needed to 
              return to the keep by the morning or he would fail. He was helped out of his 
              binds by the elf Aideen, where they went to look at the non-human reservation to 
              find the camp had been attacked by vrans. They then left and came across some Cat School 
              witchers training and wrestling. Aideen then unbound Geralt and left him to return to his master.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later on, the Wolf School and the Cat School had a 
              tournament between them, organized by King Radowit II who secretly plotted with 
              the Cat School to kill the witchers from the Wolf School. In the first round, Geralt and
               Gweld faced off, slowly realizing while they were fighting that the whole tournament was a ruse. 
               As they came to that realization however, a druid put a mind control spell upon Gweld which made 
               him violently attack Geralt, forcing Geralt to kill his friend with a sword through the chest. Right
                after this, soldiers under Radowit's command surrounded the witchers and started to kill 
              them all, but Geralt was able to escape on horseback, causing Radowit to put a bounty on his head.

            <h2>Yennefer</h2>
            <section>
              <p>
                Yennefer, born on Belleteyn in 1173,[3] was a sorceress who lived in Vengerberg, 
                the capital city of Aedirn. She was Geralt of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri,
                 whom she viewed like a daughter 
                to the point that she did everything she could to rescue the girl and keep her from harm.
              </p>
              <p>
                She helped advise King Demavend of Aedirn (though was never a formal royal advisor), 
                a close friend of Triss Merigold, and the youngest member of the Supreme Council of Sorcerers within 
                the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. After its fall, the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to recruit her, 
                but they didn't see eye to eye as the Lodge wanted to advance their own political agenda by using Ciri.
              </p>
              <h3>Biography</h3><hr>
              <h4>Childhood</h4>
              <p>
                Born in 1173, Yennefer had a rough childhood from the moment she was born, due to a congenital hunchback.
                 Her father immediately detested her due to this deformity and blamed Yennefer's mother for it, claiming
                  it was through her side, with mages and elven blood, not to mention her having had an abortion before, 
                  that caused the deformity. Her mother initially tried to protect Yennefer, believing it was by the will
                   of the gods, but her father still struck Yennefer until one day he left them both for someone else. 
                After this, her mother, upset that her husband had left, also began to beat her own daughter.
              </p>
              <h3>Description</h3><hr>
              <p>
                The lady of Vengerberg was famous for her beauty, even though she was nearly a century old. 
                Yennefer had locks of curly, raven black hair fragrant with lilac and gooseberry perfume, 
                falling in a cascade of curls on her shapely shoulders. Her face was very pale, triangular 
                in shape with a slightly receded chin. Her eyes were cold and sparkling with a remarkable 
                violet penetrating gaze, in anger blazing with livid, blue-gray fire. Those very eyes also 
                concealed wisdom and imperiousness. Yennefer's nose was slightly long, mouth was pale with 
                thin and slightly crooked, soft, sweet with lipstick, proud lips. On her long and slender 
                neck hung a black marigold 
                with a star made of obsidian sparkling with a multitude of tiny diamonds embedded in it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yen had pronounced cheekbones, natural, slightly irregular eyebrows trimmed by hand and 
                emphasized with charcoal, long eyelashes, and petite hands. Even in high-heeled shoes 
                she wasn't tall, 
                was beautiful but threatening, having incredibly thin and slender waist and slender legs.
              </p>
              <p>
                She always dressed in black and white, at times wore stockings, wore frilled panties 
                but never wore trivialities with underwire, she didn't need to. Her voice was resonant
                 and mildly derisive. Her overall feminine shape was one of a twenty-year-old girl and 
                 she moved with a natural, unforced grace. 
                She was a quadroon (meaning she had a quarter elven blood, in her case on her mother's side).
              </p>
              <p>
                It is implied that her attractive looks were a product of magic 
                and had been acquired during her training, as with most other sorceresses. 
                Geralt notes how her shoulders are slightly lopsided and by the end of the story
                 realizes that Yennefer used to be a hunchback. Nevertheless, his love for her does not diminish
              </p>
